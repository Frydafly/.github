Open Climate Fix (OCF) is a non-profit product lab, totally focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible. Every part of the organisation is designed to maximise climate impact, such as our open and collaborative approach, our rapid prototyping, and our attention on finding scalable & practical solutions.

## How to get involved?
At OCF we are passionate that all the knowledge we produce remains open, to break down intellectual property barriers and subsequently reduce the “time to impact”. We therefore encourage external users to use our base code.

There are a number of ways for you to get involved:

* Submit pull requests.
* Have a look at our [List of "good first issues"](https://github.com/search?l=&p=1&q=user%3Aopenclimatefix+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22&ref=advsearch&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=open): GitHub "issues" which describe changes we'd like to make to the code. Our coding style is [here](https://github.com/openclimatefix/.github/blob/main/coding_style.md)
* Check out which [Github repository](https://github.com/openclimatefix/ocf-meta-repo) are easy to contribute to. 
* Sign up to our [newsletter](https://ocfnews.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=substack_profile) and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenClimateFix) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/19123036/admin/) to learn the latest about our work
* Use our datasets on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/openclimatefix) or [EUMETSAT satellite data](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/eumetsat-seviri-rss?hl=en-GB&project=solar-pv-nowcasting) and let us know if it was useful. 
* Spread the word with your networks
* Use our code(!) by following the guidelines below.

## What if you use our code?

In order for us to understand the use of our models, and to demonstrate impact to future funders, it is invaluable for us to know who is using the code and if possible, how. We licence the code in this repository under a permissive MIT licence and if you are using the code or deriving from it, we request that you attribute the use of Open Climate Fix’s work in your product by adding the text below:

#### 'original code by [Open Climate Fix](https://github.com/openclimatefix)'

If you're a contributor, we'd love for you to share your work! We ask our community to refer to themselves as an Open Climate Fix Community Contributor, specifically across social media channels and on personal CVs or portfolios.
